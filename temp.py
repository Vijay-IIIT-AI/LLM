For each row, 
output should follow the format: `"Column1: {Column1_value}, Column2: {Column2_value}, Column3: {Column3_value}"`, where "Column1", "Column2", "Column3" are **generalized placeholders**. The column names should **not** be hardcoded. They should be dynamically inferred from the table headers.
