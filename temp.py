| Development            | 200,000               | 125,000             | 62.5%      | Majority spent on dev tools.           |

Some additional context about the budget and its implications. The marketing team has not yet utilized the full allocated budget, with most expenditures focused on initial campaigns and planning for future promotions.

---

### Future Milestones

We will begin planning for the next quarterâ€™s objectives after the Beta Release phase. These will be the key milestones:

1. **Final Testing**: Final testing before the full product release.
2. **Product Documentation**: Documentation will be drafted and finalized.
3. **Customer Support Setup**: Setting up customer support channels for post-launch queries.

---

### Key Risks & Contingency Plans

While we have made significant progress, there are a few key risks to monitor:

- **Resource Availability**: A few team members may be unavailable due to holidays in December.
- **Market Conditions**: Changes in market conditions could affect the marketing budget.

We have allocated contingency funds to mitigate these risks and ensure smooth progress through the next phases.
