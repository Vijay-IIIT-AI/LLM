What is the maximum systolic blood pressure recorded?

What are the unique values in the Risk_Level column?

How many patients are over 50 years old?

What is the mean CK-MB level for negative results?

What is the gender distribution of the patients?

How many patients have blood sugar levels above 200?

What is the median troponin level?

List all patients with high risk level.

What is the minimum diastolic blood pressure for male patients?

How many patients have both high blood sugar (>180) and positive result?

What is the average systolic blood pressure grouped by Risk_Level?

Show the patient(s) with the highest troponin level.

What percentage of patients require immediate medical attention?

What is the average age of patients with negative results?

How many patients are under 30 with a positive result?

Count the number of patients grouped by Recommendation.

What is the correlation between heart rate and troponin levels?

Find the range (max - min) of CK-MB values in the dataset.


##

Which combination of age group (e.g., <30, 30–60, >60) and gender has the highest average troponin level among positive cases?

What is the correlation matrix between all numerical health indicators (heart rate, BP, blood sugar, CK-MB, troponin), and which pair has the strongest positive and negative correlation?

Among high-risk patients, what is the average systolic-to-diastolic pressure ratio, and how does it compare between genders?

What is the percentage of patients with CK-MB > 5 and Troponin > 0.5 who received the recommendation "Immediate medical attention"?

Group patients by Risk_Level and find the average blood sugar, then rank Risk_Levels from highest to lowest based on this metric.

Identify outliers in troponin levels using the IQR method and list the patient details for those outliers.

What proportion of patients over age 60 with normal blood sugar (<140) still received a positive result?

Perform K-means clustering (k=3) on CK-MB and Troponin levels to identify health risk clusters. Describe the cluster centers.

Build a decision tree (basic logic, not ML) that infers the Risk_Level based on thresholds in blood sugar, systolic pressure, and troponin.

Simulate a new “Severity Score” = (Troponin × 100) + (CK-MB × 10) + (Blood Sugar / 10), and analyze how this score aligns with the Risk_Level categories.
